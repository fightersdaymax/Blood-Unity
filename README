BLOOD UNITY REPOSITORIES :: REPO # 1 INFORMATION:

This is the first of many "Blood Unity Repos" that are intended as dumping grounds (in a good sense) for freeware, abandonware, and socialware projects made for various depts and projects of the firm mentioned above.

Blood Unity is the name of a (currently underpowered) line of t-shirt designs, but soon will be empowered upon the creation of the first Blood Unity Linux-based OS.

Blood Unity stands for the fact that all humanity has blood, therefore, all humanity has Blood Unity.

Blood Unity Repositories are supposed to make the "finding hi-quality flash/java games/interactive-catalogs to play/browse" part unnaturally easy and the downloading a cinch: Just download the entire repo (sizes are limited to the greater of 50 MB or 500 files) and delete anything you don't need.

In this sense, Blood Unity is the ultimate anarchist software repository on the planet! (**We ARE NOT anarchists, however, merely collectors of flash and java games and interactive catalogs of stuff!!**)

CURRENT REPO STATS:

Files: 1
F/Games: 0
F/Intercats: 0
F/Misc: 0
F/Readmefiles: 1

ENJOY YOUR DAY!

Kiai!

(with best regards from Nathan!)
